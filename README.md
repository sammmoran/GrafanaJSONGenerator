# GrafanaJSONGenerator


Introduction
Grafana is an excellent open-source tool for generating dashboards and graphs for DevOps teams. However, one must manually insert a new Data Source and DashBoard with panels for each and every entry. For example, if one wanted to keep track of each AWS Instance running using CloudWatch, the user would have to manually create a Data Source and then a DashBoard and the panels to go with the DashBoard each and every time. This process can and should be streamlined.

Grafana (v6.2.4) relies on JSON files to construct Data Sources and DashBoards. This program offers the user the ability to create all of these things with little hastle.
